## Employment History
### Barclays wealth; November 2015 - present

_Senior Developer, contract_

**Scala, TDD, Agile**

The Boost project at Barclays aims to improve the process of onboarding new Wealth customers and I am implementing an internet-facing questionnaire to capture sole-trader account opening information. The next phase is to give the back office striaght-through-processing capabilities.

_Senior Developer, contract_

**Scala, TDD/BDD, Agile, Python, event sourcing, CQRS**

Senior developer working on Olympus, an inventory management system showing depot positions and failed trades, for the securities back office. The application was written in Scala and we adopted an event-sourced, domain-driven, CQRS-style architecture. My responsibilities also included "quality control" reviews for my team and other teams and contributing to the analysis and design process with our product owners and other stake- holders. The team adopted a Kanban approach and was very focussed on test-driven and behaviour-driven development. I was also involved in maintaining the code-quality through "clean-code" practices. We used Cucumber/Scala-Test/Jenkins for BDD and CI

### HSBC; April 2009 - February 2012

_Senior Developer, contract_

Developing both a trade repository and a golden-source system for Medium Term Notes (MTN). I was involved in the overall design of the system and I implemented of one of the main feeds into the system. This involved designing Spring Integration messaging architecture, XPath data extraction and error handling. I also designed and implemented the trade search web front-end, I implemented the spreadsheet upload for the Product Control department. I also lead the implementation of website look and feel. I suggested, and the team adopted, the use of JBehave to implement executable acceptance tests which successfully enabled us to run a full regression suite as part of our automated build.


### Barclays Global Investors; November 2006 - January 2009
_Senior Design and Development Engineer, permanent_

**Java, UML. XML/XSD. Spring, Spring Web-MVC, Sybase. Web Services. Jetty. Agile. Continuous Integration. **

I worked in a small agile team on a Fixed Income Portfolio Management system. The system was designed to take model-driven recommendations and turn them into order lists for traders. The latest phase was to add order list creation for Bond Futures using models and current positions. My role was senior designer and developer, responsible for the architectural design and implementation of key components. I developed a close working relationship with the portfolio managers. The team adopted a broadly XP approach, using test driven development, short iterations and continuous integration. We used a proprietary XML document store and I was heavily involved with the design of the appropriate schemas using XML/XSD/UML. I was also heavily involved in the workflow design and this was implemented using an event driven architecture largely using asynchronous JMS messaging.

The system was implemented as a series of server side components using Spring MVC for simple "plain old xml" services hosted in a Jetty container using JDBC, XmlBeans and Spring. Non-project work included the mentoring of two junior team members. I was also on the corporate Web Services Governance committee, which involved setting policies around project inception and assurance of quality of service.
