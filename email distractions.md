Getting “in the zone” is difficult enough, especially when the work we have been doing recently has been quite dull. But staying in the zone is a bigger challenge.

# Check email only a few times a day

We need to look at our in-boxes first thing in the working day. There could be some production incident overnight that we need to get straight on to. But we don’t need to check it every three minutes, that is a huge driver of context switching. And I think by now we all are aware that multi-tasking is a dirty lie. I try to check three times a day. First thing, just before lunch and mid afternoon

# Switch off all email notifications (alert boxes, sounds etc)

Perhaps we can’t help ourselves, we see the little notification and we seek the instant gratification of novelty. So just turn off all notifications and take control of the cycle.

# Inbox-zero

I try to keep my inbox empty, anything that sits there for a while has to be processed mentally every time you look in the inbox, even if it is to remember that you already read that, and you’re waiting on a response.  We tend to use the inbox as a surrogate for a task list and because we have no control over people inserting into that list, it doesn’t work nearly as well as a separate task manager. See this link for more

# Process quickly with one of do/delete/defer/delegate

But in order to keep the inbox clean we need to process the email quickly and easily. If you need to do something as a result of the email and you can do it very quickly (less than two minutes), then JFDI. Otherwise add it to your task list, get someone else to add it to their task list, file it for future reference or delete it (I don’t often delete things)

Do not attempt to find the right folder for every email, just save it.

Maintaining a complex taxonomy for all the emails you receive is a dull and thankless task. Just stick everything into a catch-all bucket and rely upon tags (“categories” in Outlook), search and archiving. Auto-tagging with rules can also be useful.

# Urgent Email

In typing this up I realised that there was an obvious flaw in the plan, what about urgent stuff that gets ignored if you’re not checking the email? It would be a very difficult discussion with a senior manager. if we had to admit that we had let something urgent slip for the sake of a distraction-free working environment. And this is where the role of "Face" can help, If the Face had email notifications enabled then the rest of us could turn them off without fear of a major train-wreck going un-noticed.

If you’re getting support issues sent directly to your email address, then request that the sender use the team email address instead. (Bonus, we’ll all get to see what  a busy guy you are)

# Email Signatures

I personally dislike them as I think they’re ugly, but in recognition that sometimes people do need to contact you urgently it will make that easier, and hence more likely, if you have a phone number in your email signature. I have just amended mine to include the number.

# Five Sentences

I try to make sure that all my outgoing emails are as succinct as possible. I try to keep them to five sentences (sometimes I have to cheat by excluding the salutation). See this link for more. Obviously there are exceptions (this email is one).


I apologise for the brain-dump; I hope it doesn’t provide too much of a distraction.

("Face" was a role that rotated through members of the team so that we all took an equal turn in being the contact point. It also involved going to meetings.)
